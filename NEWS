mpck

0.21 (22-06-2017)
    Finally support APE tags, which correctly identifies some files as OK
    instead of broken.

0.20 (02-04-2017)
    Got back to fixing some things after a quiet period of several years.

0.19 (28-07-2009)
	I changed the buffered I/O to use structs with function pointers.
	Almost object-oriented.

0.18 (08-12-2007)
	Eric Blanpied supplied me with a file which causes mpck to crash.
	This is valuable input for me and I used it to solve various bugs.
	Nice to have some of my users involved.

0.17 (11-09-2007)
	As Andrew Kuklewicz reported, the CRC of MP2 files was still not
	correct. This time I actually tested the code against MP1 and MP2
	files.

0.16 (12-01-2007)
	Karl Student found a bug where Checkmate MP3 checker crashes when
	the first character of a file is non-ASCII. This does not affect
	mpck.

0.15 (29-10-2006)
	Kevin Williams reported that he got read errors on some files. This
	was because of a bug in a ID3 tag searching function. It would only
	occur if the file has a T or an I in the last two bytes.

0.14 (21-05-2006)
	Some files would falsely report "No MP3", because the first frame was
	bad. Mpck would think that all following frames were inconsistent,
	finding only one frame in the whole file. This is solved by checking
	consistency with the previous frame instead of the first frame.
	I decided to skip version 0.13.

0.12 (15-02-2006)
	I did a big cleanup of mpck. The interface is now a lot cleaner, which
	makes it possible to use it as a library.

0.11
	I renamed the package of wimpck and mpck to Checkmate, to make it look
	(sound) user-friendly. Lukas <luke2@zoznam.sk> 

0.10 (12-01-2005)
	It has been a while since the last release, mainly because I wanted
	to catch some bugs instead of introducing new features. As it seems
	there are not many bugs and I am happy to hear some feature requests.

0.09 (15-02-2004)
	The exit status is now meaningful. I am not sure if mpck should return
	something other than zero if it encounters a bad file. It then did
	it's job, without errors, so the exit status should be zero. However,
	for shell scripts it could be handy.

0.08 (26-11-2003)
	The way errors are reported is somewhat changed, so mpck now also prints
	what is wrong in the file. I will not introduce new features in
	mpck till 0.10, only fix bugs.

0.07 (18-11-2003)
	I tried to fork mpck for speed improvement, but it didn't work.
	Too bad. So only some small fixes in this release.

0.06 (05-10-2003)
	I have implemented buffered I/O, so that reading files is quicker. This
	is optimized for harddisk speeds, it can have a negative effect on
	network access etc.

0.05 (04-09-2003)
	I recently looked over the features of mp3check (Ryan Gordon) and I
	think it is not too hard to make mpck a replacement for mp3check.
	So I did some work on filename checking, but it is not yet
	finished.

0.04 (01-09-2003)
	These CRC codes are giving me a headache.
	I have ported mp3check to Windows and renamed it mpck, inspired by
	fsck, the file system checker utility.

0.03 (26/08/2003)
	I split checkfile in check_begin and check_end. Mp3check now first
	searches for the last frame (check_end), so that check_begin nows where
	to stop.

0.02 (02/05/2003)
	GDB is cool!!! The GNU Debugger has helped out with most segfaults
	and floating point exceptions. Learn it! Use it!
	I made macro's of some functions to speed things up, but running
	mp3check on Ogg Vorbis files still take ages. ;)

0.01 (30/04/2003)
	What purpose has the NEWS file? Is the ChangeLog file not enough
	already?
