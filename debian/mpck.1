.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mpck 
checks mp3s.
It scans the file to see if the frames are where they are supposed to be, 
if the frame headers are correct and if the headers are consistent throughout
the file. It gives some statistics on the file, and a conclusion whether the
file is good or bad.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b --bytes BYTES
Scan only the first
.B BYTES
bytes.
.TP
.B \-B --badonly
Print statistics only for bad files.
.TP
.B \-e --extention=EXT
Scan only files ending in 
.B .EXT
.TP

.TP
.B \-m --maxname=NUM
Report bad for a file which has more than num characters in its filename.

or
.B bad
for each file.
.TP

.SH BUGS
.PP
The -b and -f options make the statistics go all wrong. This is not really
a bug, the program can only acquire statistics to the limit indicated by
-b or -f.
Mpck cannot read from stdin. CRC and ID3 support is buggy.
